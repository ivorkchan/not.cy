## Code-Free Platforms

While building my portfolio back in 2021, I explored user-friendly tools like Cargo, Framer, and Webflow.

Last year, I discovered Vercel and Next.js, starting my journey with the official repository. Without prior experience, I built a simple [website](https://blog.ivorkchan.vercel.app/), then created several [widgets](https://blog-tw.ivorkchan.vercel.app/collection) fetching data from Notion and NeoDB.

[Nobelium](https://github.com/craigary/nobelium) resonated with my needs. After removing unneeded features, I refined the [styles](https://blog-nobelium.ivorkchan.vercel.app/blog/debug). However, I came across an issue where text sections were cut off in WebKit browsers:

<Graphic src="/images/2023/safari-bug.png" alt="Below: Safari on Mac" />

Hereâ€™s the CSS code:

```css
.notion em {
  @apply font-serif;

  font-size: calc(1rem + 2px);
  letter-spacing: 0;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

Unexpectedly, disabling the `opacity` setting resolved the problem.
