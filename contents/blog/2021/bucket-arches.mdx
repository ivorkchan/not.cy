## Intro

Current research on Chinese bucket arches has yet to diverge significantly from traditional architectural studies, highlighting the need for a renewed focus on ethical design principles. A closer examination of the perspectives held by the two prominent schools of Chinese philosophy, Confucianism and Taoism, towards technology unveils intriguing contradictions. Although both philosophies generally express reservations about technology and related fields, they display divergent attitudes when it comes to specific instances, as technology plays a crucial role in societal progress. For instance, Confucianism adopts a positive stance towards technologies that support the manifestation of its ethical and moral values, while dismissing others.

The relationship between Tao and technology in ancient Chinese philosophy presents an intriguing contradiction. With the understanding that “Tao represents the essence, while technology signifies the end”, a critical question arises: how can design logic transition from the principle of “form follows function” to the notion that “form surpasses function”?

In ancient times, with limited cultural and technological advancements, numerous prominent philosophical schools stressed the importance of embracing nature and strongly condemned efforts to modify, challenge, or exploit it. However, it is worth considering whether this approach should evolve to suit contemporary times. In the context of the highly developed twenty-first century, should we reconsider our stance and instead adapt nature to better fulfill human needs?

Technology itself is neutral; however, its applications, including the bucket arch, may not be. As the bucket arch undergoes various stages such as design, production, assembly, usage, and ultimately becomes a symbol, what diverse meanings does it convey? Does it embody a form of micro-power? When an arch is designed exclusively for individuals of a specific status, does it communicate a message from the artisan or perhaps from an invisible, higher authority during the design process?

## Origins

Ancient Chinese design principles revolved around observing imagery, utilizing images to convey meaning, and developing inventions or tools with a deep respect for these images. One theory posits that the bucket arch’s origins are rooted in astronomical observations, as it was perceived to symbolize the Big Dipper. In ancient China, the Big Dipper held immense significance, as people noticed its position in the sky varied with the seasons, while the bucket spoon consistently pointed towards the North Star at the celestial center. This observation may have given rise to the association between the arch and the Big Dipper. According to folklore, the Big Dipper represented the emperor’s carriage, which was believed to patrol his realm and complete a full circuit annually. Ancient Chinese architecture held a strong connection to the cosmos and could be regarded as a scaled-down representation of the universe. By adopting the universe as the image, the construction process could be interpreted as a form of applied metaphysics.

The application of the bucket arch was linked to the “central duzhu style” of architecture, which persisted during the Qin and Han dynasties. In this architectural style, the central pillar represented the heaven pivot, rendering it a vital component of the ancient cosmic model. The upper end of the heaven pivot was believed to connect to the emperor’s palace, and a representation of the Big Dipper was frequently positioned atop it to fulfill the model’s function and design.

## Metaphors

The arch, as a representation of architectural art, communicates various meanings to those involved in technical disciplines, the recipients of its services, and the broader public.

### Scepter

In primitive societies, knowledge about the world was collectively shared by the entire tribe to address the common survival needs of the community. Primitive people believed in supreme deities not only to satisfy their rational curiosity about the world but also to meet their needs for guidance and protection. However, as societies developed social classes, knowledge became increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select few, such as slave owners and nobles. Consequently, individuals who possessed knowledge of mystical practices gained elevated social status.

Over time, the authority to interpret the cosmos gradually transitioned into the hands of the emperor, who maintained exclusive access to the divinatory instrument known as the arch. This allowed the emperor to communicate with both heaven and earth. As a result, the arch came to symbolize royal power, and the information it conveyed underwent a transformation. This shift in power coincided with the consolidation of kingship and the diminishing influence of divine power, leading to the gradual naturalization and abstraction of the Supreme God, as well as the fading of his anthropomorphic representation.

The emperor harnessed primitive myths to legitimize the rationale behind kingship and to govern through divine authority. In this process, he prioritized the significance of humanity over celestial forces, positioning kingship as a new myth and instrument of control.

### Ruler

Following the Han Dynasty, Confucian classics progressively became an integral component of Chinese culture. Concurrently, the wooden framing system in traditional Chinese architecture started to develop, reaching maturity during the Tang and Song Dynasties. In his approach to understanding architecture, Li Jie drew from the classical expressions of Confucianism, perceiving architecture, and construction as tools for establishing a harmonious world order. He maintained that construction should adhere to the laws of nature, observe the rites, and foster a rational order.

The arch played a pivotal role in this system, embodying a comprehensive hierarchical structure utilized to strictly distinguish social status and emphasize privileges. From princes to commoners, each group adhered to a specific building system with precise guidelines for materials, size, quantity, and color. This not only demonstrates the ancient Chinese people’s enduring endeavors to explore the foundations of architectural principles, but also highlights how architecture was employed to symbolize and structure social order.

### Context

In contemporary times, the arch has lost both its structural and functional importance, with its symbolic significance now divided between modern and traditional contexts. The technological revolution has prompted a shift in building construction methods, with the adoption of reinforced concrete supplanting wooden framing, rendering the arch obsolete. Ideologically, the dissolution of the feudal system contributed to the vanishing of the arch’s symbolic power.

The arch’s original meaning has faded, leaving its decorative nature as its primary remaining value. It has transformed into a symbol of traditional culture, representing a connection to history and regional identity while establishing a cultural context. Although the arch no longer serves practical functions, it still bears considerable importance in denoting national cultural identity and shaping or reinforcing social distinctions.

## Reflections

In ancient China, symbols held great importance, as they were believed to have the power to replace facts, reinforce knowledge systems, and sustain psychological equilibrium through a complex and organized structure. This symbolic system functioned like a ritual that established societal order by aligning with the order of the universe, even if it was merely a symbol, suggestion, or metaphor. The interpretation of a symbol depends on the decoder’s knowledge and cultural background; any deviation from the encoded meaning may lead to misinterpretation. Decoding also evolves with the code, contingent on social consciousness.

Roland Barthes, in his work _Mythologies_, contends that mythic thinking shares similarities with ideology, and the notion of myth can elucidate a civilizing process that clarifies why historical circumstances appear natural. This, in turn, uncovers the vices of ideology that have been previously concealed.

In ancient China, forging a connection between humans, heaven, and earth involved organizing human relationships. Architecture served as a mediator for communication with nature, fostering a distinct relationship between users and the natural world. Additionally, architecture was employed to structure social order. As the meaning of the arch transitioned towards power, palace design started to prioritize size and aesthetics. The necessity for robust architectural structures and the need for identification and demonstration culminated in an aesthetic direction focused on grandeur. The objective was to establish distinctions between social ranks and materialize the external manifestation of power.

Technology is neutral, yet it can amplify or diminish the impact of human perception in shaping the world. In primitive societies, people pursued mystical powers and extracted images from nature to develop symbols. The incorporation of the arch in architecture transformed building design into a form that mirrored the universe, bestowing upon humans the capacity to communicate with heaven and earth—this was the arch’s original symbolic significance. Although this meaning gradually dissipated over time, the arch’s representative function in denoting hierarchical status grew and became solidified under enduring social constraints.
